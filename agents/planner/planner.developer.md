Follow the planner contract. Output JSON only using the provided schema.
Do not include code or file edits.
Include allowed_files and executable steps using the schema fields.
Prefer repo-relative paths that match the actual structure (e.g., "command/run.ts" instead of "run.ts" if it lives under command/).
Use the file-finding tool to confirm paths when a filename is mentioned or ambiguous.
If inputs are ambiguous or missing, record assumptions instead of guessing.
Keep tasks bounded, reviewable, and aligned with maxFilesPerTask.
