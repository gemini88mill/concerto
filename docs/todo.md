# Overview

This is where the todos are for this project to be viable

## MVP Tasks

- have this able to operate on its own server, accepting requests and putting outputs
- more complex testing
  - right now I have done very minor changes, but I expect that there will need to be more complex changes that need to take place, and this thing needs to handle it.
- ability to accept .md and .json as input for the run.
- create a queueing system for multiple runs to go through the agents when they become available.
- code cleanup, come up with standards for the app style guidelines

## Next Steps

- better UI system
  - loading spinners
  - REPL mode
  - status for runs
  - chalk.js
- Dashboard (Like hangfire but simplier)
- customizable agents and agent flows

## bugs

- seems liek pr isn't getting sent to github
